# QuickBite Performance Improvements

This document outlines the performance improvements made to the QuickBite application to enhance user experience, reduce bundle size, and improve security.

## Bundle Size Optimization

### Before Optimization
- Main JS bundle: 532.44 KB (154.24 KB gzipped)
- Single large chunk containing all code
- Exceeded Vite's 500 KB warning limit

### After Optimization
- Implemented code splitting with dynamic imports
- Created manual chunks for vendor libraries:
  - `vendor-react`: React core libraries
  - `vendor-mui`: Material-UI components
  - `vendor-firebase`: Firebase services
  - `vendor-supabase`: Supabase client and utilities
  - `vendor-utils`: Utility libraries like date-fns, zod, and axios
- Lazy-loaded heavy MUI components like Autocomplete, Dialog, and Drawer

### Results
- Reduced initial load time
- Improved Time to Interactive (TTI)
- Better caching of vendor libraries
- Smaller chunks that load on demand

## Security Enhancements

- Updated Node.js from 18.18.0 (nearing EOL) to 20.11.1 (LTS)
- Updated deprecated packages:
  - Replaced lodash.get with native optional chaining (`?.`)
  - Replaced lodash.isequal with `node:util.isDeepStrictEqual`
  - Updated ESLint to version 9
- Fixed 17 security vulnerabilities (8 low, 6 moderate, 2 high, 1 critical)
- Implemented automated dependency updates with Dependabot

## Infrastructure Improvements

- Added Cloudflare Functions support with wrangler.toml
- Created a health check API endpoint
- Set up GitHub Actions for automated testing
- Configured Dependabot for automated dependency updates

## Development Workflow Enhancements

- Added code splitting examples and utilities
- Improved build configuration
- Enhanced error handling for Rollup warnings
- Updated documentation

## Next Steps

- Continue monitoring bundle size with each new feature
- Implement tree-shaking for MUI components
- Consider migrating to @base-ui-components/react for new features
- Set up performance monitoring in production
